<ocr-interpreted-line>week—end meeting. But he told M Ps yesterday: ”I have no knowledge of secret</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>negotiations.” He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal Government.</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>But the ﬁnal decision remained with the British Government. Mr. James Callaghan,</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Labour’s Colonial spokesman, said Sir Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>by refusing to sit round the conference table.</ocr-interpreted-line>
