<ocr-interpreted-line>Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was evident that voters were bored by the</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Government’s frequent appeals to the electorate. The election was the fourth in four</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>years. In most constituencies it may go down as the most apathetic in the country’s</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>history. THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons last night that he had con-</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>sidered early in the Parliamentary recess whether to mobilise reserves necessary to</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>bring the British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing.</ocr-interpreted-line>
