<ocr-interpreted-line>Mr. Pearson is now talking about ”his new and dynamic liberalism” and this week will</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>show perhaps how far ”Mike” will go. The main topic under review is unemployment,</ocr-interpreted-line>

<ocr-interpreted-line>in Canada to the problems of the Atlantic provinces. However, be this election year</ocr-interpreted-line>
