<ocr-interpreted-line>This emphasis on the legality of the former Government suggests that all is not well</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>with the political and military leadership of the pro-communists. Most of the province</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>of Xieng Khouang and the tactically useful Plain of Jars, however, appear still to be</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>ﬁrmly in their hands. The Government has claimed the recapture of Vang Vieng, the</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>pro-'communists’ former base 60 miles north of Vientiane, but this claim had been</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>made before the end of last month.</ocr-interpreted-line>
