<ocr-interpreted-line>Rhodesia on his return from Scotland yesterday. He summoned Mr. Iain Macleod,</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Duncan Sandys, Commonwealth Relations Secretary for</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>an hour’s talks at Admiralty House. A statement is expected today to hold the door</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>open for modiﬁcations to the new Constitution provided law and order is maintained</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>in Northern Rhodesia.</ocr-interpreted-line>
