<ocr-interpreted-line>On the speciﬁc question of the use of Blue Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft’s task will be</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>easier. He can point out that this is the only rocket and launcher in Europe to have</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>reached a sufﬁcient stage of development for adaptation as the ﬁrst stage in putting</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>a heavy satellite into outer space. There has also been some talk of adopting another</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>British rocket, Black Knight, for the second stage, but the French have one of their</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>own called Veronique which they would like to see used.</ocr-interpreted-line>
