<ocr-interpreted-line>Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on a new Conservative booklet</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>called The Record Speaks which outlines in some detail the accomplishments of the</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>party since it came to office three and a half years ago. Nevertheless there is little</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>illusion in the Conservative Party that their stock at home has fallen in the face of</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy.</ocr-interpreted-line>
