<ocr-interpreted-line>is making progress. His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that"even after</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>the proposed changes the net cost of the service to the Exchequer will have increased</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>over three years by 20 per cent.</ocr-interpreted-line>
