<ocr-interpreted-line>MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded defence of the Polaris missile base.</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>And by implication he supported the establishment of sites in Britain for the training</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>of German troops. His main theme was that nuclear weapons were necessary to</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>defend Britain, that Britain must depend on Nato and "the West" must have nuclear</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>weapons so long as the Soviet Union has them.</ocr-interpreted-line>
