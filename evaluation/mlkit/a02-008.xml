<ocr-interpreted-line>Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys, Commonwealth Relations</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Secretary, that they wish to be kept in touch in London. Three of them - Canada,</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Australia, and New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening meeting in</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>London on Monday. Once the Common Market's Council of Ministers draws up the</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>procedure for negotiations in a fortnight's time, these Commonwealth countries can</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>arrange for observers to advise the British negotiating team.</ocr-interpreted-line>
