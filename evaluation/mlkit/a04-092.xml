<ocr-interpreted-line>There are three kinds of reasons that justify the protests and these should carry weight</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>with the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. "The first of these reasons is the</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>importance of preserving the hitherto cordial relations between the U.S. and Great</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Britain, not only in Government circles, but in public opinion." Earl Russell says it is</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>inevitable, though profoundly regrettable, that the agitation against the Polaris base</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>has generated some antagonism to the policy of the United States.</ocr-interpreted-line>
