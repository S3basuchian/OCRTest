<ocr-interpreted-line>Mı r. Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, who arrives in Bonn tomorrow for talks</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>with the Federal Government on a European space satellite project, will find the</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Germans interested in the principle of space research, but rather sceptical about</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>British plans for organizing it. Stated more bluntly, they are still unconvinced that</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to salve Blue Streak, which was</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>abandoned last summer as a military project; or that the new European space satellite</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>is indeed to be purely scientific in character.</ocr-interpreted-line>
