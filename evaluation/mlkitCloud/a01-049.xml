<ocr-interpreted-line>Senator Allen Ellender, of Louisiana, sparked off the opposition by telling a television</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>audience it was "current Washington gossip” that Weaver once had Communist affilia-</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>tions. The Senate Banking Committee, which is headed by another Southern Senator</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>- Willis Robertson, of Virginia - met today in closed session to discuss Weaver's ap-</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>pointment. Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter to Mr. Kennedy</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>saying he had received several complaints about Weaver's loyalty.</ocr-interpreted-line>
