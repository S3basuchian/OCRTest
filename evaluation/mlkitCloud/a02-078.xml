<ocr-interpreted-line>SIR Roy Welensky said today that he no longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Ken-</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>neth Kaunda. Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister, said that Mr. Kaunda's</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>United National Independence Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia National</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda until he was outlawed in 1959. The record of</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>lawlessness among UNIP supporters went back a long way, Sir Roy told the Federal</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Parliament in Salisbury.</ocr-interpreted-line>
