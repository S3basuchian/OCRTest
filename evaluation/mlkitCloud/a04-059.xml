<ocr-interpreted-line>The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base in the Holy Loch, only 30 miles</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>from Glasgow, a city with two million people. It should be sited in a more remote</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>area. Mr. Gaitskell added that the Scarborough conference decisions did not, in his</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority of party members and still less the</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>party's supporters in the country.</ocr-interpreted-line>
