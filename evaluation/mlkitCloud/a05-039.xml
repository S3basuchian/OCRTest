<ocr-interpreted-line>There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing towards the Nationalist party of Dr.</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Verwoerd, the Prime Minister. This implies the disappearance of the Progressive</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>party from the House. Early results in yesterday's general election showed Nationalists</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>being returned in their strongholds, like Bloemfontein and the Transvaal, with slightly</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>increased majorities. In the Cape, the veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was defeated in his constituency, Salt River, by</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>the United party candidate, Mr. H. M. Timoney.</ocr-interpreted-line>
