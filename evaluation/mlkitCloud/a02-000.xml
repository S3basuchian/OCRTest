<ocr-interpreted-line>Gaulle this month to smooth the way. General de Gaulle's official welcome last week</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>to Britain's moves towards the Six was taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall, but</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>no more than that.</ocr-interpreted-line>
