<ocr-interpreted-line>Sir Roy's United Federal Party is boycotting the London talks on the Protectorate's</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>future. Said Mr. Nkumbula last night: "We want to discuss what to do if the British</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Government gives in to Sir Roy and the talks fall through. There are bound to be</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>demonstrations." Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide, Mr. Julius Greenfield, telephoned</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>his chief a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan at Chequers.</ocr-interpreted-line>
