<ocr-interpreted-line>King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of native kingdoms in Uganda arrived</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>for talks with Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod, before the Uganda Constitutional</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>conference opens next Monday. The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>The thorniest problem for next week's conference is to settle the relationships between</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>them and the rest of the country. A Government report has recognised their rights</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>and recommended a form of federal association, but the four kings are not committing</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>themselves and not attending the actual conference, although Buganda politicians have</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>agreed to do so at the last minute.</ocr-interpreted-line>
