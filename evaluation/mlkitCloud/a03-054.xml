<ocr-interpreted-line>Everything is being done to promote a new image. Certainly, he is now a much</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>tougher character politically than when he took over the leadership. He was merci-</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>lessly trounced by Mr. Diefenbaker in the House in those early days. It has been a</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>hard road back but now, with plenty of political ammunition given him by the Gov-</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>ernment in recent sessions, he is leading the Opposition with skill and assurance and</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>is a match for the Prime Minister across the floor.</ocr-interpreted-line>
