<ocr-interpreted-line>Informal talks at Lancaster House will resume today. PRESIDENT KENNEDY today</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>defended the appointment of a Negro as his Housing Minister. It has aroused strong</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the Deep South. The negro is Mr. Robert</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>Weaver of New York. One of his tasks will be to see there is no racial discrimination</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>in Government and State housing projects.</ocr-interpreted-line>
