<ocr-interpreted-line>Sir Edward Boyle, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday that the Gov-</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>ernment does not like retrospective legislation. He went on to describe the kind of</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>people the Chancellor hopes to tax. These are people buying and selling shares within</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>a short period, those ”stagging” on a new issue and property dealers who form a chain</ocr-interpreted-line>
<ocr-interpreted-line>of companies and put one property deal through each.</ocr-interpreted-line>
